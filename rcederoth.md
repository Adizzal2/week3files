I've made a change because I needed to.

# Insert your bio

I'm a former wannabe musician turned wannabe WebDev. Discovered a passion for coding when I volunteered to build a website for my band, ended up consuming my life. 
Been self-learning Javascript ever since. 

I work full time as tech support for an X-ray imaging software, which is why I can't be in class or in the Zoom sessions with you guys. 
It'd be great to network and collaborate with all you though!

With Melissa's permission, I started a Discord channel for all the WebDev students so we could connect more. Email me for an invite link!
