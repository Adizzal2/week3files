#Nicholas Robert
#Born January 9, 1996 in Orange County California. Grew up in Lake Elsinore CA, in a loving home with a mom, dad, and one older sister. Years later I am not living in freezing cold Wisconsin and attending school at Blackhawk Technical College. My hobbies include video games, drawing, gunpla, comics, manga, and now web development.
